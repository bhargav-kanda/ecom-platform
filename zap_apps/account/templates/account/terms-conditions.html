<p><strong><u>Integrating Third Party  Services within the Services</u></strong>: </p>

<p>One of the special features  of the Service is that it allows you to enable various online third party  services, such as Facebook Connect, Gmail, Yahoo etc and other social media and networking  services, payment service providers etc. (&quot;Third Party Services&quot;), to  be directly integrated into your Zapyle experience. To take advantage of this feature, we will  ask you to provide us your username and password for the relevant Third Party  Services. By enabling such Third Party Services, you are allowing us to pass  your log-in information to these service providers for this purpose. When you  add a Third Party Service account to the Service, we will collect your login  information and other relevant information necessary to enable the Service to  access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party  Service. As part of such integration, such Third Party Services will provide us  with access to certain information that you have provided to such Third Party  Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance  with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which  Third Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed  solely by the policies of such third parties, and Zapyle shall have no liability or responsibility  for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Service that may  be enabled within the Service. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At Zapyle&apos;s  or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or  relating to these Terms of Service or the Service that are not resolved by  mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before  the sole arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,  1996 and place of arbitration will be held in &nbsp;Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The arbitration  must commence within 30 (Thirty) days of the date on which a written demand for  arbitration is filed by either party.
